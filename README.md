BCB HW14, Using Handlebars
This homework has a live Heroku App with a live MySQL database!  You can create a new burger and eat it!

## Notes
------
Uses ORM functionality:

* selectAll : Used as a READ from the MySQL database in order to get all burgers for displaying on the DOM
* insertOne : Allows a CREATE operation on the MySQL database in order to cook up a new tasty burger
* updateOne : Allows an UPDATE operation on the MySQL database so you can tell what burgers have been eaten!
